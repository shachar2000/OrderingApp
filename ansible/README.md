# ðŸ“¦ Ansible Playbook: OrderAppServer & Monitoring Setup

This playbook installs and configures the OrderAppServer application and monitoring tools using Docker, node_exporter, and Logstash on Ubuntu servers.

1. **Installs Docker** and ensures the service is running.
2. **Runs the OrderAppServer container** from Docker Hub.
3. Creates an external log file at `/home/ubuntu/AppOrderServer.log` and mounts it to the container.
4. **Installs and starts node_exporter** on port `9200` for monitoring.
5. **Installs Logstash**, copies a configuration file, and sets up a `systemd` service for automatic execution.
